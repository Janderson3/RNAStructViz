Visualization software for RNA secondary structures.

The software has been verified to work on Linux and Mac systems. 
It requires the g++ compiler, the X11 and OpenGL libraries, and the FLTK package to be installed on your machine. 
X11 and OpenGL often come packaged with the g++ compiler on many systems.

Installing FLTK:

To download FLTK, go to http://www.fltk.org/ and look for the latest stable build version of fltk 1.3 (version 2.0 or later will NOT work). 
After you have downloaded and unpacked the archive, navigate to the fltk directory from the terminal and run
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
to install it on your machine. 
Note: the "sudo make install" command will ask for the password associated with your login and requires that your user profile has administrator access.

Ubuntu users, can alternatively run "sudo apt-get install libfltk1.3-dev" from the terminal and to install FLTK and any other necessary packages.

Fedora users can run "sudo yum install mesa-libGLU-devel mesa-libGL-devel flt-devel" in the terminal to get the dependancies for this program.

To test that FLTK is installed on your machine, type
  fltk-config --version
in the terminal and check that it recognizes the command and returns the expected version number. 


Installing RNAStructViz:
Download the repository from https://github.com/gtfold/RNAStructViz (by clicking the "ZIP" button).
After unpacking the archive, navigate to the RNAStructViz-master directory in a terminal window. 
Run the following:
  ./configure
  make
If successful, the RNAStructViz executable will appear in the RNAStructViz-master/src directory.

Running RNAStructViz:
Type
  ./RNAStructViz
From within the directory containing the exececutibel described above.
